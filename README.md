**Overview**

The Number Guessing Game is an interactive Python application where the player tries to guess a randomly generated number between 1 and 100.
The program provides feedback (“Too high” / “Too low”) after each guess and limits the number of attempts based on the chosen difficulty level.

This project demonstrates my progression from simple input/output programs to structured, function-driven coding with logic and conditions.

Learning Objectives & Technical Implementation

Through this project, I gained hands-on experience with several core and intermediate-level Python concepts:

**Concept & Description**

1. Functions & Code Reusability - Implemented modular functions like check_answer() and set_difficulty() to make the code clean and maintainable.
2. Conditional Statements (if-elif-else) -	Used branching logic to compare user input with the actual number and provide feedback accordingly.
3. Random Number Generation -	Utilized Python’s built-in random module to generate unpredictable numbers for gameplay.
4. While Loops & Game Flow Control - Created a controlled loop to manage player attempts until the game ends.
5. Difficulty Settings - Added “easy” and “hard” modes with different attempt limits to improve interactivity.
6. Importing External Modules - Imported a custom art module for displaying a logo and enhanced console aesthetics.
7. User Input Validation -	Reinforced learning of input() and integer typecasting for robust user interaction.

This project deepened my understanding of control structures, function design, and user-driven logic, which are key in scalable software development.


**Example Gameplay**

Welcome to the Number Guessing Game!
I'm thinking of a number between 1 and 100.
Choose a difficulty. Type 'easy' or 'hard': easy
You have 10 attempts remaining to guess the number.
Make a guess: 60
Too high.
Guess again.
Make a guess: 45
Too low.
...
You got it! The answer was 48.
